Order Information  
 
"I need a 5-step order creation process where users first enter customer information, then  sink selection  sink families  with quantity and Build number entry  then select sink configurations, then configure add on accessories , and finally review everything before submission."
Every selections has a part number starting with 700's indicated with the their implementation logic( these part numbers are going to be in the order Summary page as a generate Bom button and allowing to share and export sections ) check the inventory database to fetch the full details of the bom items(parent child relations full part no and part name)   


First step 
Customer Information 
 1. Order Information:
    - poNumber: PO Number (string, min 3 characters)
    - customerName: Customer Name (string, min 3 characters)
    - projectName:(string,min 3 characters, optional)
    - salesPerson: Sales Person (string, min 3 characters )
    - wantDate: Desired delivery date (date, must be in future)
    - po document upload area 
    - Notes (text entry)
    - EN,FR

Sink Configuration 

First
CleanStation Reprocessing Sinks has 3 families
 	
-MDRD
-Endoscope CleanStation	
-InstroSink

	We are going to implement only for the MDRD versions other 2 selection brings us to TODO page (under construction)
  
In here with selection also quantity and unique build number  needs to be submitted. every Sink configuration could be different and they have their own configuration page after finishing one sink completely. the button needs to redirect to remaining sinks for start again  	 
After the build number entry now on it is going to be its unique identifier and all configuration settings align to this build number 

after that  we can separate the sink configurations as      Sink Body 
 
1 Sink body: 

	Sink Model: (T2-B1, T2-B2, T2-B3) drop down selection 
	This is determines how many basin that sink going to have B1 is one basin b2 is 2 basins b3 is 3 	basins 
		
	Sink Dims:  text boxes ( text entry as inches for width and Length)
	According to the length entry. One of the  those assembly needed to be in the BOM  for example if the length entered 54in    709.82	T2-BODY-48-60-HA this part going to be on the BOM
		
		709.82	T2-BODY-48-60-HA
